## Purpose
* A model-specific product image clustering to provide price comparison services.
* Recognise the seller's image and help by auto-classifying it into the appropriate Malcolm.

## Functions
* Clustering is performed based on learning through training datasets.

## Result
* Accuracy in training set : 99%
* Validation accuracy : 93%
* 99% accuracy in our training is less than 5%set, so this is enough for practical application.
